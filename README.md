This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Application description

This is a very basic POC for me to try out Recoil.js how to perfom in large amount of spatial data using react-leaflet. 
I used fake.js to generate random coordinates and city.

## Map functionalities

1. Select pre-defined number of amount of data.
2. If user hover on a circle marker, then an informaton box show it.
3. The user can search for different locations. If a location found, then the application zooming in.
